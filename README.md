# Features

# Technologies Used
- JavaScript
    - The project uses JavaScript (minigame.js) for our minigame (spin the wheel).
    - The project uses JavaScript (feedback.js & script.js)for the feedback form.
    - The project uses JavaScript (w3-include-HTML.js) for the header of all the pages, the title and the navigation bar

- 

# Testing
1. Home page (Index.html)
    1. Click on the Groceries
    2. It will direct you to the page where it shows the groceries

2. Groceries page (Groceries.html)
    1. Click on the add to cart of the first pork belly item (row 1, column 1)
    2. It will direct you to the cart page (Cart.html)

3. Minigame page (Minigame.html)
    1. Try spinning the wheel

- I encountered one bug/problem when I am testing my spin the wheel game. I realised that after spinning the wheel, the result displayed and the result on the wheel is different.

- After adding the item to cart, the item is not able to be linked to the cart page which shows the item, quantity, price that was added to the cart, therefore, after clicking on the add to cart, it will just direct you to the cart page.
